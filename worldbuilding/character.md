# Character & Progression

A character and their progression is made up of a number of aspects:

- Rank
- Attributes
- Essences
- Essence Abilities
- Racial Abilities
- Titles

## Ranks

In these ranks, each rank is a tier of power stronger than the last.

To progress to the next rank you must level all of your abilities to their 10th level of that rank.

The ranks are as follows:

- Normal
- Iron
- Bronze
- Silver
- Gold
- Diamond
- Transcendent

### Other Ranks

There are other ranks that are not directly linear in progression to the above ranks. These ranks are:

- Gods
- Astral Kings
- Great Astral Beings

Generally there is no common knowledge of the ranks beyond Gods. Most mortals are unaware of the existence of Astral Kings and Great Astral Beings. Even diamonds rankers are considered legends to most mortals.

#### Gods

These are generally stronger than Diamond rank, but are bound to the world or realm they preside over, and are also bound by their given domain, with checks and balances in their relationships with other gods, and with mortals.

#### Astral Kings

#### Great Astral Beings

## Attributes

- Power
- Recovery
- Spirit
- Speed
