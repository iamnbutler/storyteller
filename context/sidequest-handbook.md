# The Sidequest Handbook

## I. Introduction

### A. Purpose of the Handbook

This handbook is designed to provide definitive guidance for crafting side quests that enrich the gaming experience. It is an essential resource for game developers, writers, and designers seeking to create side quests that seamlessly integrate narrative depth, character development, and interactive storytelling with the core plot.

### B. Understanding Side Quests

Side quests are narrative branches that expand the game world through character interactions, discoveries, and conflicts. These threads offer players additional layers of engagement by revealing more about the characters, both playable and non-playable, and the game's setting. A well-designed side quest can enhance the main storyline by building relationships and providing a break from the central narrative's intensity.

## II. The Pursuit of Balance: Scope and Gravity in Side Quests

### A. Defining the Scope of a Side Quest

Successfully designed side quests vary in length and complexity, ranging from a simple, solitary task to an intricate series of events that unfold as the game progresses. Developers must decide the scope—how extensive and how many steps or challenges a side quest will encompass—ensuring it aligns with the overall pace and progression of the game.

### B. Establishing an Index for Side Quest Scope

To provide a clear framework, an index can help define the scale of side quests to keep their scope in check:

- Minor Discovery (Scale 1): These are brief, rewarding experiences such as uncovering a hidden gem within a wall crevice, finding a rare ingredient for a local apothecary, or decoding a cryptic message carved into an old statue.

- Local Adventure (Scale 2-3): These quests involve slightly more investment, like tracking down a series of stolen goods, solving the mystery of a haunting in a village, or organizing a local festival that boosts morale.

- Regional Adventure (Scale 4-5): At this scale, quests have far-reaching consequences for a broader area and might include tasks like negotiating peace between warring factions, disrupting a crime syndicate's operations, or curing a disease plaguing the countryside.

- Personal Quest (Scale 6-7): These multi-stage quests revolve around character-driven stories such as aiding a companion in seeking redemption for past actions, helping an NPC reclaim their rightful inheritance, or assisting an artisan in creating their magnum opus.

- Epic Endeavor (Scale 8): These quests are extensive and often serve as a secondary narrative, such as leading a revolution to overthrow a corrupt government, embarking on a series of trials to become a champion of the gods, or assembling an alliance to fend off an invasion.

- Legendary Journey (Scale 9-10): The most expansive of quests that unfold over the entire game's duration, often deeply intertwined with the lore, might involve quests like unravelling the mystery of a fallen civilization, thwarting a prophecy that spells doom, or guiding a character on a path from zero to hero within the game's epic tale.

Most side quests should fall within the range of Local Adventures and Personal Quests, with the occasional Epic Endeavor or Regional Adventure to add depth to the game world.

### C. Considering the Links to the Main Narrative

A side quest can weave through the main storyline, enhancing it without dominating. The scope of the quest should therefore be reflective not only of its importance but how it complements the primary journey the player is on.

### D. Writing Side Quests with Immersive 'Day in the Life' Experiences

Encouraging exploration of the everyday, these quests can be any scale but should always deepen the connection between the player and the game world. They strike a chord with authenticity, revealing the mundane yet fascinating aspects of life in the game's setting.

**Key Takeaways:**

- DO map out side quests using the scope index to ensure they are proportionate within the game's overall design.
- DO develop side quests that can complement and occasionally intersect with the main narrative to enrich the gaming experience.
- DO create side quests that resonate with the players through relatable tasks and challenges.
- DON'T let side quests deviate into a scale so broad or long-term that they become indistinguishable from the main story.
- DON'T dilute the significance of the main storyline with excessive side quest content.
- DON'T overlook the potential for small-scale side quests to deliver compelling experiences and contribute to the game's allure.

## III. The Structure of a Side Quest

### A. Call to Adventure

The initial hook of a side quest — a personal plea, a local rumor, or a curious anomaly — invites the player to divert from the main path. This moment should be intriguing and provide just enough information to pique the player's interest.

### B. Introduction of Characters

Character introductions are pivotal; through dialogue and interaction, the player encounters various personalities. These NPCs can present differing motives, backgrounds, and connections to the problem at hand.

### C. Set Stakes

Clear, localized stakes set the side quest's tone and urgency. These stakes should relate directly to the characters involved, the immediate community, or the player's interests.

### D. Rising Action

Gradually escalate the quest with obstacles and challenges that fit the narrative context. Interjections of character commentary and evolving dialogue should keep the player invested.

### E. Climax or Turning Point

The climax is the critical confrontation or decision point. Character opinions and the existing rapport with the player can significantly color this moment, offering a test or pivot point in the narrative.

### F. Falling Action

The immediate aftermath of the climax, tying up loose ends. NPCs react, rewards are doled out, and the consequences of the player's actions begin to unfold, often through reflective dialogue.

### G. Resolution

See the tangible effects of the quest — in the world, the characters, and within the player's own journey. The seeds of the player's choices sown earlier should now bear fruit in satisfying ways.

### H. Optional Connection to Main Story

Where fitting, side quests may offer subtle ties to the main story, enhancing the lore and adding layers to the overall narrative without becoming essential to the progression of the main plot.

**Key Takeaways:**

- DO introduce engaging hooks that draw the player into the side quest's narrative.
- DO create dynamic and well-developed characters whose interactions enrich the quest.
- DO clearly define what's at stake to drive the quest forward with purpose.
- DO utilize character interactions to enhance the narrative, especially during key quest phases.
- DO showcase the outcomes of the quest, offering a resolution that reflects the player's decisions.
- DON'T create side quests that leap into action without proper context or engagement.
- DON'T insert forgettable or underdeveloped characters that fail to add depth to the quest.
- DON'T neglect to establish and communicate the stakes, leading to a lack of investment in the quest's outcome.
- DON'T allow the climax to happen without meaningful character involvement or emotional resonance.
- DON'T skip on depicting the quest's consequences, as it is crucial for demonstrating the player's impact on the game world.
- DON'T force connections to the main story if they don't naturally fit within the quest's narrative.

## IV. Decision Points in Side Quests

### A. Importance of Decision Points

Decision points give the player a sense of agency and engagement, allowing them to influence outcomes and participate actively in the story's unfolding. They can also invite replayability if different decisions lead to different outcomes.

### B. Placement in Side Quest Structure

Consequential decisions often fall at the climax or turning point. However, smaller decisions can be distributed throughout the rising action, affecting the game's flow and potentially influencing the climax.

### C. Impact of Decisions on Gameplay

Decisions can alter gameplay by influencing enemy behavior, character relationships, and available resources. This furthers player immersion and fosters a sense that their choices matter in the game world.

### D. Designing Effective Decision Points

Effective decisions present clear but tough choices, with foreseeable outcomes. They should resonate with the quest's stakes, echo the game's themes, and make sense within the narrative context.

**DOs:**

- DO incorporate meaningful decision points that can influence outcomes.
- DO focus on placing decision points where they can have the greatest impact.
- DO let decisions affect gameplay, offering diversity and unpredictability.
- DO design decision points that are clear, compelling, and reflective of the game's overall tone.

**DON'Ts:**

- DON'T overuse big decisions; they can desensitize players to their importance.
- DON'T make outcomes random or unfair; players should feel their choices genuinely matter.
- DON'T create decisions that feel forced, unplanned, or inconsistent with the quest's scope.

## V. Looping and Recursion in Side Quests

### A. Need for Looping

Looping adds dimension to a side quest by making it dynamic rather than linear. It brings about complexity and opportunities for deeper exploration or repeated engagement.

### B. Points of Looping within the Structure

Common loop points reside where new issues can logically arise after previous resolutions. Typically, this is after a quest’s resolution or at decision points where different pathways can loop back to earlier stages.

### C. Creating Recurring/Episodic Side Quests

Recurring quests, much like episodic stories in other media, allows for character development, deepened mysteries, and world-building over time. They might require more conceptual planning but can enrich the overall gameplay.

**DOs:**

- DO use looping to add depth and engagement.
- DO carefully plan loop points for logical coherence.
- DO consider recurring quests for gradual world expansion and enriched gameplay.

**DON'Ts:**

- DON'T complicate side quests with excessive or confusing loops.
- DON'T lose narrative consistency when designing loop points.
- DON'T make recurring quests too repetitive or disconnected from overarching game themes.

## VI. Scaling of Stakes in Side Quests

### A. Using the Stakes Scale

A well-defined scale for stakes can help balance how consequential a side quest feels to the player. It creates consistency and enables developers to match the side quests' intensity with their narrative situation.

Consider a scale like the following:

- 1 (Fetch quest, collection quests; negligible impact)
- 2 (Solving minor disputes; low impact, limited to NPCs)
- 3 (Securing resources or territory; local importance)
- 4 (Resolving significant conflict such as a feud; impacts a community)
- 5 (Defeating a local threat; prevents harm to the region)
- 6 (Recovering/protecting a valuable artifact; significant to cultural/national heritage)
- 7 (Overthrowing a tyrant; frees a jurisdiction)
- 8 (Eliminating a regional threat; safeguards many communities/cities)
- 9 (Fighting a formidable menace; preserving a kingdom/continent)
- 10 (Preventing world-ending scenario; well, the survival of the world)

### B. Aligning Stakes with Player & Game Tone

Stakes should align with the mood and expectations set by the game's overall tone. The intensity of side quests in a lighter game will be different from those in a grim, high-stakes main plot.

### C. Designing Impactful Stakes

Stakes should matter to the NPCs, communities, or the player character themselves. Even without world-ending consequences, stakes can still be meaningful and evoke emotional investment.

**DOs:**

- DO use a stakes scale to balance importance and consequence in side quests.
- DO align stakes with the game's overall tone and storyline.
- DO design stakes that are compelling and important within the game's context.

**DON'Ts:**

- DON'T inflate stakes unnecessarily—it can dwarf the main storyline.
- DON'T misalign the side quest stakes with the game's tone—it can disrupt players' experience.
- DON'T make stakes impersonal or irrelevant—they should matter within the game world.

## VII. Useful Tips and Tricks for Side Quest Creation

### A. Balancing Gameplay and Narrative

Side quests are an opportunity to balance exploration, combat, puzzles, and dialogue within engaging stories. The gameplay elements should feel integral to the quest narrative, not superimposed onto it.

### B. Ensuring Side Quests Complement the Main Story

Side quests should add to the world-building, character development, and themes established by the main story. They should enhance, not detract from or contradict, the primary narrative.

### C. Fostering Player Engagement through Side Quests

Side quests can help sustain player interest and investment. This is achieved by offering varied challenges, enriching the game world, unfolding interesting stories, and rewarding player effort.

**DOs:**

- DO strive for a balance between gameplay and narrative elements in side quests.
- DO ensure side quests complement, and not detract from, the main story.
- DO use side quests as a tool for maintaining and boosting player engagement.

**DON'Ts:**

- DON'T ignore the narrative in favor of gameplay, or vice versa—both are integral.
- DON'T contradict your main story with the events or details in your side quests.
- DON'T design side quests that are too tedious or unrelated to the game’s world—they can discourage engagement.
