Prompt Type: Quest

Impacts: Current Party, Current Location

Checks:

- If there is a third party in the side quest, check if any {Party Member} has an existing relationship with them.

Format:

- Start with a sentence or two describing the current situation.
- Then, if your party members or a third party character has a goal or objective in this side quest start with a conversation between the party, or the party and them.
- Then, describe the side quest and its objectives.
- Add a <Decision Point> marker with options when a choice needs to be made.
  Outcome:
- If the side quest is completed, the party gains a reward.
- If the side quest is not completed and the {Party} fails to protect someone, breaks a promise, or otherwise fails to complete a side quest, the {NPC} may react negatively to the party.
- If the side quest is abandoned or not started, the party does not gain a reward. {NPC} may react negatively to the party.

Take context from the current location. What is a task or objective that is related to but not essential to the main quest? These could make good side quests.

Example:

- You are exploring a dungeon and find a locked door. You can look for the key or find a different path.
- You meet a new character. They ask you to find a missing person.
- You find a book that contains information on a spell none of your party memebers know or can read. You can try to dangerously learn the spell or find someone who can teach it to you.
- You find something that looks out of place. You can investigate it to see if there are any hidden secrets.

It is important to note that dialog, interactions, quest outcomes and relationships don't have to be happy or positive. In a fantasy world people get hurt, bad things happen, and people's quality of life isn't always good.

Consider your current {Party}. Is there something one of your party members wants to do? Is there a skill or ability they want to learn? Is there a character they want talk to? Is there a location they want to visit? Is there someone they want to improve their relationship with?

Example:

- A party member wants to learn how to cook to make better food on your travels. You can find a chef who can teach them.
- A party member is likes to collect new knowledge. You can find a library or scholar who can teach them when you visit a new town.
- A party member needs to maintenance their equipment. You can find a blacksmith or tailor who can repair or upgrade their gear.

Try to make the side quest interesting and engaging. It should be challenging enough to be rewarding, but not so difficult that it feels impossible.

- A side quest should be optional.
- A side quest should be interesting and engaging. It should have some sort of payoff.
- Side quests should have different difficulty levels. Easy, medium, and hard. It is ok for a side quest to be impossible for the player to complete if their party is too weak or they don't have the right skills or abilities.
- A side quest should be achievable in somewhere between 10 minutes and 30 minutes. A larger side quest should be split into a Quest Chain.
