# Campaign Background

Baldur's Gate, a city of opportunity and danger, stands as a bustling metropolis on the Sword Coast—a place where ambition and intrigue mingle with commerce and trade. It's a city of stark contrasts, where the wealthy patriarchy resides within the Upper City while the Lower City teems with working folk, gangs, and the destitute. The recent events of the "Iron Crisis," with its turmoil and strife, have passed—but not without leaving scars and tales that still echo through the cobbled streets and tavern whispers.

This campaign begins in the Year of the Warrior Princess (1490 DR), a time of tentative peace punctuated by the underlying tensions that follow any struggle. Trade has begun to flourish anew, with Baldur's Gate reasserting itself as a vital hub for merchants, artisans, and adventurers alike.
