# Campaign Background

Baldur's Gate, a city of opportunity and danger, stands as a bustling metropolis on the Sword Coast—a place where ambition and intrigue mingle with commerce and trade. It's a city of stark contrasts, where the wealthy patriarchy resides within the Upper City while the Lower City teems with working folk, gangs, and the destitute. The recent events of the "Iron Crisis," with its turmoil and strife, have passed—but not without leaving scars and tales that still echo through the cobbled streets and tavern whispers.

This campaign begins in the Year of the Warrior Princess (1490 DR), a time of tentative peace punctuated by the underlying tensions that follow any struggle. Trade has begun to flourish anew, with Baldur's Gate reasserting itself as a vital hub for merchants, artisans, and adventurers alike.

You newly arrive to the city with dreams of grandeur, only to find that your daily routine consists of hard labor and monotonous tasks. The streets of Baldur's Gate are more about survival than excitement, filled with laborious work and the occasional rumble of carts over stone. By the Elfsong Tavern, the chatter rarely speaks of adventure; instead, it revolves around the price of ale and the day's earnings. Here, trust is as hard-earned as a day's wage, and often just as fleeting.

As you settle into your day-to-day routine as a barhand at the Elfsong Tavern, a place filled with the clinking of tankards and the murmur of countless stories, your ears catch whispers that cut through the monotony. In a shadowed corner, you overhear a group of patrons speaking in hushed, eager tones about a recent heist where they robbed a caravan and stashed the goods within the confines of an old, abandoned warehouse at the city's edge.

Your eyes flicker between the wooden planks of the floor and the patrons as you lean inconspicuously against a nearby wall. You strain your hearing to catch more of their conversation without drawing attention.

The burly man, Rulf, whose muscular build hints at a life of hard toil—likely a fighter or laborer—lowers his voice further and leans in. Dark tattoos creep from beneath his rolled sleeves, suggesting possible ties to the local thieves' guild, "The loot's secure, but we move tonight. Dock district. Keep it tight, no blabbering to outsiders."

A slim figure with sharp elven eyes, possibly a rogue given her dexterous fingers playing with a dagger's hilt, sitting across from him, nods slowly. Her cloak is tattered but bears the faint emblem of a raven, "Understood, Rulf. But how do we know we can trust Brin?" she asks, motioning subtly towards a jittery man who could be a halfling or a very small human, his cloak hood drawn tight to obscure his face.

Rulf's eyes, cold and calculating—perhaps once full of the camaraderie known to seasoned mercenaries, now show nothing but distrust, "We don't. Which is why he's on watch duty. Makes even a hint of noise, we'll know he's compromised."

Brin, whose twitchy demeanor suggests a high-strung rogue or an out-of-his-depth bard, catches the tail end of his name and perks up. "Don't worry about me. I can be quiet as the grave," he whispers, though the nervous quiver in his voice, coupled with the way his hand never strays far from the hilt of what could be a hidden blade, does little to instill confidence.

Curiosity piqued, you continue to eavesdrop. One of them, a burly man with a scar tracing down his cheek, seems to be the leader of their small band—though it's clear from their demeanor that trust is as limited amongst them as it is amongst any who walk the streets of Baldur's Gate.

As your mind races with possibilities, the weight of the decision presses upon your shoulders.

1. Report the information to the city guard
2. Investigate the warehouse yourself
3. Hint that you might want to join their next heist
4. Ignore the information and continue with your day
