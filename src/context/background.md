# Campaign Background

Baldur's Gate, a city of opportunity and danger, stands as a bustling metropolis on the Sword Coast—a place where ambition and intrigue mingle with commerce and trade. It's a city of stark contrasts, where the wealthy patriarchy resides within the Upper City while the Lower City teems with working folk, gangs, and the destitute. The recent events of the "Iron Crisis," with its turmoil and strife, have passed—but not without leaving scars and tales that still echo through the cobbled streets and tavern whispers.

This campaign begins in the Year of the Warrior Princess (1490 DR), a time of tentative peace punctuated by the underlying tensions that follow any struggle. Trade has begun to flourish anew, with Baldur's Gate reasserting itself as a vital hub for merchants, artisans, and adventurers alike. Among these faces are four individuals, brought together by circumstance and convenience rather than destiny. Each seeks to make their mark—not through grandiose heroics or world-saving bravado but through the pursuit of personal goals and the lure of coin and reputation.

Their initial coalition forms around a common need: securing employment in guarding a merchant caravan that routinely travels between Baldur's Gate and Waterdeep. The task appears mundane—ensuring the safe passage of goods along the well-trodden paths of the Trade Way. However, the roads are far from safe, with banditry on the rise and whispers of darker forces at play. It’s a simple job that promises routine pay, yet the Sword Coast is known for the unexpected, and it's often the simplest decisions that lead to the most compelling stories.
