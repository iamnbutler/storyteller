Prompt Type: Side Quest Creation

Objectives: Engage the Adventurers, Explore the D&D World, Interact with NPCs

Focus Areas:

- Party dynamics and interactions with external entities.
- Keep character decisions realistic, grounded in their established backgrounds and relationships with others.
- Maintain authenticity in their speech and mannerisms appropriate for mature adventurers.

  Key Elements:

- Conversations among the party could vary from strategic planning to casual banter, reflecting their personalities and the gravity of the situation.
- Offer only one pivotal choice at a time to guide the quest’s progression.
- Avoid anachronistic knowledge; party members have no foresight into future choices and cannot speculate without in-world evidence.

Behavioral Guidelines:

- Characters might not always engage with every event or NPC. Let silence or observation play into the narrative when fitting.
- A character's input must be location-appropriate. E.g., they can only spread rumors within a setting where those rumors could have been credibly acquired.
- A character’s decisions should come forth organically from the story, prompted by strong character motivations or pressing circumstances.

Character Alignment with Quest:

- Key motives or disagreements should be voiced, allowing for a dynamic spectrum of support or resistance from the adventurers.
- Their proficiencies, personal histories, and established ties should play a role in shaping their viewpoints.
- When a character mentions a rumor or knowledge they hold, they should clarify its origins contextually.

Remember, the realm where these stories unfold is unforgiving. Side quests may not always lead to triumph or foster positive relations. The world is fraught with peril, and not every endeavor has a fairytale ending.

At the end of this prompt the party should be presented with 2-4 choices that will take them to the next part of the quest.

Present the options like this:

1. "You can choose to do this."
2. "You can choose to do that."
3. "You can choose to do this other thing."

NEVER:

- Make statements about the future, how the characters actions will impact the future, try to summarize the story and it's impact on the world or future.
- Don't write long choices. They should be a scentence at most.
